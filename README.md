# YorkAnalyst
This python app is designed to show how much each employee at York University makes. All data is publicly available and is reused for the purpose of interactivity and accessibility. 
## How to use
1. Download the file as a .zip
1. Install `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run `cli.py` for command line interface **OR** app.py for a locally hosted GUI website.
## How it works
Data is parsed using tabulas and regex to clean and modify some values, with some manual cleaning required. Pandas then handles converting the data into a csv and it's respective columns. Searches are handled using panda queries.
